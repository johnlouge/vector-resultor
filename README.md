The script returns a single function as per being required. The argument accepts any number of arrays, which will represent a set of vectors, and wherein all arrays include: the magnitude of the vectors as a number at the first index, per an angle given in degrees as a number for the second index. 
During the calculation, consider that the resultor is calculated by the ordnance that the said arrays are given in during input.
